        <h5>ingredients</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>12 covers for empanadas</li>
            <li>1/2 kg. minced meat</li>
            <li>2 onions</li>
            <li>2 dientes de ajo</li>
            <li>1/2 pimiento morr√≥n rojo</li>
            <li>1 tomato</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. tomato puree</li>
            <li>Peppers</li>
            <li>salt and pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Step by step</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a pot with hot oil add the onion and the bell pepper. Let brown for a few minutes and when they are half cooked (transparent onion), add the garlic and a little salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Raise the heat and add all the minced meat at once. Move the meat so it doesn't stick. When the meat is sealed, add the diced tomato and the 2 tablespoons of tomato puree. Season with paprika and cumin, a little more salt and pepper and mix well. Cover (not completely, leave a small hole) and cook for half an hour, stirring little by little.</li>
            <li>Remove from the heat and let cool in the pot.In this step you can add anything else you want: hard-boiled egg, raisins, potatoes, etc.</li>
            <li>Distribute the filling in the empanada covers, and close with a traditional repulgue. Before putting them in the oven you can paint them with egg, but it is very comfortable and optional.</li>
            <li>Put our meat empanadas on a plate and bake in a strong oven until golden brown and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>And that is how is made the empanadas</p>
